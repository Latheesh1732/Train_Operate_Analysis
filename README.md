## 🛠️ Project Phases and Tasks

### ✅ Level 1: Data Exploration and Basic Operations

#### Task 1.1: Load and Inspect Data
- Display the first 10 rows.
- Understand data structure and types.
- Identify missing values.

#### Task 1.2: Basic Statistics
- Total number of trains.
- Unique source/destination stations.
- Most frequent source/destination stations.

#### Task 1.3: Data Cleaning
- Handle missing values.
- Standardize station names (uppercase).

---

### 🔄 Level 2: Data Transformation and Aggregation

#### Task 2.1: Data Filtering
- Filter trains operating on specific days (e.g., Saturdays).
- Extract trains from a specific source station.

#### Task 2.2: Grouping and Aggregation
- Count trains from each source.
- Average trains per day per station.

#### Task 2.3: Data Enrichment
- Add a column categorizing 'Weekday' vs. 'Weekend' trains.

---

### 📊 Level 3: Advanced Data Analysis

#### Task 3.1: Pattern Analysis
- Weekly journey distribution.
- Route trends (source → destination).

#### Task 3.2: Correlation and Insights
- Analyze train frequency vs. day of the week.
- Derive operational recommendations.

---

### 📈 Level 4: Visualization and Reporting

#### Task 4.1: Visualization
- Bar charts, line graphs, heatmaps using Matplotlib & Seaborn.

#### Task 4.2: Reporting
- Clear report of insights, trends, and visuals.

## 📌 Final Deliverables

- ✅ `train_analysis.ipynb`: All code, cleaning, analysis & plots.
- ✅ Visualizations: Saved in `images/` folder.
- ✅ `README.md`: This document, summarizing your work.
- ✅ Summary Report: Embedded in notebook or exported as PDF.

## 📌 Key Insights & Recommendations (Sample)

- **Most active source station**: NEW DELHI
- **Busy days**: Friday and Sunday
- **Underutilized routes**: Highlighted in heatmap
- **Recommendation**: Optimize train frequency on high-demand routes during weekends.

---

## 🗂️ Version Control

- Versioned with **Git** for tracking code changes.
- Commit messages reflect tasks and progress.
- Branches used for feature testing and final integration.

---

## 🧠 Learning and Challenges

- Learned effective data cleaning strategies.
- Explored visual storytelling using Seaborn.
- Faced challenges with pivoting & heatmap formatting (resolved using type conversions).
